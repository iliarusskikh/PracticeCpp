//The & in Test& fun() means fun() returns a reference to a Test object (not a copy or a pointer). A reference is an alias for an existing object, allowing further operations on the same object without creating a copy.
//In this case, fun() returns *this, which is a reference to the current object (t in main()). This enables method chaining, where each call to fun() returns the same object, allowing the next fun() call to be made on it.
